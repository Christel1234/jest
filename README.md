# Jest

This is an exercise based on Jest.

## Instruction to get going:

Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then you're ready to go.

**Note:** Choose only one package manager (`npm` or `yarn`), then stick with that package manager throughout the app e.g. If you use `npm install`, don't add new packages with `yarn add package-name`.
